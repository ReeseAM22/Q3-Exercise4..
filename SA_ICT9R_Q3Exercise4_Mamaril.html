	<h2>Dubai</h2>

	<hr>
	<p>Dubai is a beautiful country filled with its rich culture, landscapes, and cities. Spending my Christmas here was a blast! I got to visit my cousins who live there. We went to so many places everyday that I could barely remember if we ever got rest, but it did not matter as we were having too much fun to notice. Here, I will be sharing the places that you could visit if you ever get the chance to go to Dubai.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Fun things to do: </h2>
	<br>

	<h3>Expo City</h3>
	<img src="Expo.jpg" height="50%" width="100%">
	<hr>
	<p>One of my first stops here was Expo City. It's essentially a futuristic city where pavillions, architectural designs, events, shows, and more are seen. Since it was the festive season, me and my family got to watch Christmas shows in a big dome with bright lights, you can see it on the right picture behind me. Overall i think it was a nice experience getting to see the bright ideas of the people, and I can't wait to see more in the future.</p>

	<h3>Dubai Mall</h3>
	<img src="DubaiMall.jpg" height="50%" width="100%">
	<hr>
	<p>You might be wondering why am I suggesting a mall, but you won't even believe how massive this place is. It carries so much shops from top to bottom. You can visit huge designer stores, bookstores, restaurants, and a whole aquarium. And this place holds a perfect view of the Burj Khalifa and you can also watch an amazing and colorful fountain show. I recomemend to go here during night where the tallest building can show off it's bright glittering lights. </p>
	<hr>

	<h3>Atlantis Dubai</h3>
	<img src="Atlantis.jpg" height="50%" width="100%">
	<hr>
	<p>Last but not the least is the infamous Atlantis Dubai. This hotel is gigantic as it holds a whole waterpark, aquarium, michelin restaurants, and many more. Staying here was so much fun, I don't even think I got to visit every place the hotel can offer. My favorite spot here was the waterpark as me and my family rode daring and steep slides that had us screaming (I lost my voice for a while). The hotel is by far in my top 3 favorite spots in Dubai.  </p>
